# MatrixSolver

This Python package is capable of traversing a matrix in multiple different ways.
Currently there are two traversals implemented:
- Spiral
- Horizontal

## Python version
Since we use Type hints in this script, the minimum requirement
for running this script is `Python 3.5`.

## Running tests
Running test can be easily done with the usage of `Pytest`
```bash
$ pytest
```
